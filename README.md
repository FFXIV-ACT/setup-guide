## Configuring ACT

### Running as Admin
It is recommended that ACT be run as Admin. You can right click on the ACT shortcut and select the **Run as administrator** option. You may get an UAC prompt, select yes.

You can also configure ACT to always run as admin by right clicking on the shortcut then selecting **Properties**. In the **Properties** window, select the **Compatibility** tab, then check the **Run this program as an administrator** option. Click **Apply** to save the changes. This will ensure ACT is always run as admin.

## FFXIV ACT Plugin

Upon first running ACT, it will prompt you with the Startup Wizard. If you forget to download a parsing plugin, ACT will prompt you again the next time you run it, or you can manually open the wizard by going to **Options** > **Miscellaneous** > **Show Startup Wizard**.

![startup_wizard](resources/startup_wizard.png)

In the **Parsing Plugin** section of the startup wizard, ensure `FFXIV Parsing Plugin` is selected from the dropdown, then click the `Download/Enable Plugin` button. You will receive an alert when the plugin has been added to ACT. Click **Ok** to dismiss it.

![parsing_plugin](resources/parsing_plugin.png)

Click **Next** to move to the log file section. ACT will ask if it will be used for Final Fantasy XIV. Select **Yes** to configure ACT logs for FFXIV.

![log_file](resources/log_file.png)

Click **Next** to move to Startup Settings, then **Close** to accept the default settings and finish the startup wizard.

At this point `FFXIV_ACT_Plugin.dll` should be enabled in **Plugins** > **Plugin Listing**.

![ffxiv_act_plugin](resources/ffxiv_act_plugin.png)

## OverlayPlugin

From the **Plugin Listing** tab, click on the `Get Plugins...` button near the upper right corner. This will open a window that will populate with available plugins for ACT.

![get_plugins](resources/get_plugins.png)

In the **Get Plugins** window, select the `[FFXIV+others]Overlay Plugin` option and click on `Download and Enable`. This will add the latest ngld **OverlayPlugin** to ACT (the OverlayPlugin auto-updater may also run during this step).

![get_plugins_window](resources/get_plugins_window.png)

The OverlayPlugin should now be setup. Click on the `X` to close the **Get Plugins** window.

## Adding an Overlay

### Preset Overlays

Ngld's OverlayPlugin comes with built-in presets for a majority of popular overlays. To setup an overlay go to **Plugins** > **OverlayPlugin.dll** and click on the `New` button. 

![new_overlay](resources/new_overlay.png)

This will open the **Create new overlay** dialog. Enter a **name** for the overlay and select a **preset** from the dropdown (the overlayplugin will show you a preview of each preset). Once you have selected your desired overlay, click on the **OK** button to add your overlay.

![add_overlay](resources/add_overlay.png)

Your overlay should now appear in the overlays list. Select it from the list to view and edit its settings. You can move your overlay to the desired position, then check the **Lock overlay** box to lock it in place.

![overlay_settings](resources/overlay_settings.png)

You can add additional overlays using the same steps. Certain plugins, e.g. cactbot plugin, will populate the preset dropdown with additional presets for their respective overlays.

### Custom Overlays

For an overlay not available in the presets, select the **Custom** option from the dropdown and the desired **Type**. For most overlays, it will be the **MiniParse** type.

![custom_overlay](resources/custom_overlay.png)

In the overlay settings, make sure to add the overlay **URL** source. It can be a web url or the path to a local html file.

![overlay_url](resources/overlay_url.png)

## FFLogs Uploader

### Installing the Uploader

Navigate to the [FFLogs Download](https://www.fflogs.com/client/download/) page and download the FFLogs client application for your platform. 

![fflogs_download](resources/fflogs_download.png)

Find the `FFLogsUploader` install application in your downloads and run it. The application will ask you whether to install for all users or just yourself. Click on the **Install** button after selecting your choice then **Finish** once the installation is done.

![fflogs_installation](resources/install_uploader.png)

### Uploading a Log

*Note: You will need to [register](https://www.fflogs.com/register/) for an FFLogs account in order to upload logs.*

Run the FFlogs Uploader application. Enter the account information you used to sign up. Once you are authenticated, click on the **Upload a Log** button.

![upload_log](resources/upload_log.png)

Click on **Choose** to select the log to upload.

![choose_log](resources/choose_log.png)

In the File Explorer, navigate to the folder where the log is saved. The default location is at `%APPDATA%\Advanced Combat Tracker\FFXIVLogs`. You can copy and paste that path in the explorer bar to go directly to the default folder.

![log_folder](resources/log_folder.png)

In the log folder, selected the desired log to upload, and click on **Open**. To ensure the latest log is on top, you can sort by **Date modified**.

![log_location](resources/select_log.png)

Choose the desired access level for the log: **Public**, **Private**, or **Unlisted**. Public will be ranked and Private and Unlisted are un-ranked. Anyone will be able to view a Public log. Private logs can only be viewed by you. Unlisted logs can be viewed by anyone with the link to the log.

If you want to upload only a specific encounter, toggle the **Select Specific Raids To Upload** option, then click on the **Go!** button.

![log_options](resources/log_options.png)

Select the specific encounter you want to upload from the list and click on the **Go!** button. You may select multiple encounters by holding *`Ctrl`* on your keyboard. 

*Note: this view is only available if you selected specific raids to upload.*

![select_fight](resources/select_fight.png)

Once the uploader is finished uploading the encounters to the FFLogs website, click on **View Report** to open up the page in your default browser and view the log results.
